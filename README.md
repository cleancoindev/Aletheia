> An AI-powered epic translation comparison tool.

### About
Aletheia takes a pair of translations of a specific piece of text and compares them side-by-side using the results of several machine learning models. This allows us to compare/contrast the liberties taken by translators in word choice, sentiment, and phrasing.

### CC303: Mythology
> **The general prompt for a creative project is the place of classical mythology in the modern world.** To some extent, any creative project in this class is about the place of classical mythology in the modern world -- your project is created by and for a modern audience, after all -- but this prompt asks you to contemplate what you are creating, and/or why, and/or how you are creating it. If you are drawn to depict or represent a particular character, event, scene, or idea, for example, why do you think that is important to you? Why does that character, event, scene, or idea move you (or why does it not)? Can that reflection be incorporated into the art? Does the medium you are working in allow for new possibilities that were not available to the ancients? Why might this be important? These are all examples of questions that a creative project might seek to answer.
